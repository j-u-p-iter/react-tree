react-tree expose API, that:
  - allows get access to activeIndex (getActiveIndex method);
  - toggle active index (toggleActiveIndex method) (to be able to open/close item)

Let's create react-tree. This react tree can be used to create rubric trees, navigation and similar tree-type structures.

The main parts of such tree:
  - config. This is data, that define tree structure.
    Config should contain unique keys to determine each node. Depending on tree nature this key can contain rubric slug, path and etc.

  - node coordinate. Key concept in the whole tree. Coordinate determines the way to find node.
    Coordinate consists of index of node on eash sub level (from top to bottom, from left to right).

  - treeMap - this is the map between each unique key of each node and coordinate of this node.
    For navigation it can look like this:
    {
      '/some-path': '1:2:3:4:5',
      '/completely-another-path': '1:2:10:4'
    }

  Several stages:
    - initialization stage.
      During this stage we:
      - write config to state and extend this data with several additional data (new keys for each node):
        * active: Boolean;
      - create treeMap to be able to find node by it's id very quickly, using coordinates.
